
`Archiconda3` is a distribution of conda for 64-bit ARM platform. 
Since Archiconda3 is tailored for ARM64 computer (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Devices-Jetson TX1/TX2), the setup process is different from the one with the normal Anaconda.
The aim of this repository is to create a conda environment on `aarch64`.
